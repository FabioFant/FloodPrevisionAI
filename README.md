# 🚀 FloodPrevisionAI

🌊 **FloodPrevisionAI** is a Unity-based italian simulation project developed as a concept for territorial innovation. It visualizes how an artificial intelligence system *could* predict river flood risks by analyzing environmental data collected from sensors, drones, and weather stations.

This prototype was created as part of a school project and is designed to demonstrate the potential of combining real-time environmental monitoring with AI-powered risk assessment. The simulation mimics the behavior and output of such a system through scripted logic and data visualization.

## 🔍 Project Goals

- 💡 **Promote awareness** on flood risk prevention through simulation
- 📡 **Represent a smart monitoring system** with virtual sensors
- 🎮 **Visualize environmental changes** (rain, water saturation, etc.)
- 📊 **Simulate AI predictions** of danger levels based on input data

---

## 🧠 Features

- 🏞️ **3D River Environment**: Realistic terrain with dynamic water level changes.
- 🌧️ **Weather Events Simulation**: Random rainfall that affect river behavior.
- ⚙️ **Virtual Sensors**: Simulated inputs such as rain intensity and soil saturation.
- 🔮 **Danger Level Prediction**: Emulated AI logic that classifies flood risk as *Safe*, *Dangerous*, or *Very Dangerous* based on current conditions.
- 🖥️ **User Interface**: On-screen panel showing live data from sensors and predicted risk level.

> 🧠 Note: This project does *not* include a real neural network. The "AI" is a scripted logic that imitates predictive behavior for demonstration purposes.

## 🎯 Key Benefits

- 🧪 **Safe Experimentation**: Observe flood behavior in a controlled 3D environment.
- 🎓 **Educational Tool**: Ideal for learning about environmental monitoring and how AI could enhance natural disaster management.
- 🔧 **Extensible Foundation**: Easy to expand with real AI models, new sensors, or enhanced UI in the future.
